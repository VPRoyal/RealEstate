## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Property Listings**: Users can view, add, and manage property listings.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search filters to find properties based on various criteria.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility across platforms.

## System Architecture

The Real Estate Website follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend (Client)**: Developed using Next.js, React.js, and Redux, the frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Backend (Server)**: Built with Node.js and Express.js, the backend handles client requests, processes business logic, and communicates with the database.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to manage user information, property listings, and related data, ensuring data integrity and persistence.

## Detailed Component Overview

### Backend (API)

The backend is responsible for handling client requests, processing business logic, and interacting with the database.

- **Controllers (`API/controllers/`)**:
  - **`authController.js`**: Manages user authentication processes, including login and registration.

- **Models (`API/models/`)**:
  - **`User.js`**: Defines the schema for user data, including fields like username, password, and contact information.
  - **`Property.js`**: Defines the schema for property data, including fields like title, description, price, location, and images.

- **Routes (`API/routes/`)**:
  - **`authRoutes.js`**: Defines endpoints for authentication-related operations.
  - **`propertyRoutes.js`**: Defines endpoints for property-related operations.

- **Middlewares (`API/middlewares/`)**:
  - **`authMiddleware.js`**: Contains functions to verify user authentication and authorization.

- **Utilities (`API/utils/`)**:
  - **`db.js`**: Manages database connections and configurations.

- **Configuration (`API/config/`)**:
  - **`config.js`**: Stores configuration settings, such as database connection strings and secret keys.

- **Server Setup (`API/server.js`)**:
  - Initializes the Express application, sets up middleware, and starts the server on the specified port.

### Frontend (App)

The frontend provides the user interface for the application, allowing users to interact with the system seamlessly.

  - **`login.js`**: User login page.
  - **`register.js`**: User registration page.
  - **`dashboard.js`**: User dashboard displaying their properties and account settings.
  - **`property/[id].js`**: Detailed view of a single property listing.

- **Redux (`APP/redux/`)**:
  - **`actions/`**: Contains action creators for user authentication and property management.
  - **`reducers/`**: Contains reducers to manage the state of user authentication and property listings.
  - **`store.js`**: Configures the Redux store and middleware.

- **Styles (`APP/styles/`)**:
  - **`globals.css`**: Global styles applied across the application.
  - **`Home.module.css`**: Styles specific to the homepage.

- **Public (`APP/public/`)**:
